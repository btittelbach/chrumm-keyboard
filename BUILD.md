3D printing
-----------

I printed the parts on a Prusa Mini, with PLA filament,
on a smooth PEI sheet. The gcode was generated with
[PrusaSlicer] 2.6.0. The 3MF files with the exact settings
are available on the [Releases] page.

PCB preparation
---------------

A jig is provided to bend the diode legs uniformly.
Note that the gap between the PCB and the body is only
about 1mm. Therefore, the diodes are soldered on the
side facing away from the body. After soldering, the
legs are cut reasonably flush on the body-facing side.


Flexstrip
---------

The PCB halves are connected via Flexstrip board-to-board jumpers.
To compensate for the split angle, the strips need to be folded in
a specific way before installation. Check the image for reference.
I wrapped them around a thin screwdriver shaft, to maintain a
minimum bend radius of about 2mm.
