- 12x Countersunk screw, M3, 8mm total length, ISO 10642
-  7x Hex nut with nylon insert, M3, ISO 10511
-  2x Hex nut with nylon insert, M2
-  7x Socket head cap screw, M3, 8mm thread length, ISO 4762 (*)
-  2x Socket head cap screw, M2, 6mm thread length, ISO 4762
-  2x Ziptie, 2mm width, 1mm thickness

(*) Some of the screws are difficult to reach and
require a ball-point driver, or a short-armed key.


Electronic
----------

-  2x PCB
-  1x Raspberry Pi Pico, SC0915, without pre-soldered headers
-  1x USB cable, A to micro-B with small head, shielded, max 4mm diameter
- 64x Diode, 1N4148, DO-35 through-hole format
- 64x MX switch
-  1x Bourns PEC11R-4215F-N0024 rotary encoder, M7 nut mount, 15mm flatted D-shaft
-  1x TE Flexstrip FSN-22A-8, 0.1" pitch, 2" length, 8 conductors (**)
-  1x TE Flexstrip FSN-22A-5, 0.1" pitch, 2" length, 5 conductors (**)
-  1x TE Flexstrip FSN-23A-3, 0.1" pitch, 3" length, 3 conductors (**)

(**) It might be cheaper to buy strips with
more conductors and cut them apart as needed.
